🔧 Propane Generator

Gives old generators a second life! Refuel them with propane to make them quieter and more reliable. Perfect for creating stealth bases in the city.


📖 About the Mod


The Problem

The game has old generators. They are too loud and break down quickly. Usually, players don't even pick them up — it's easier to find a regular generator or do without electricity. But what if these rare finds could get a second chance?


The Solution

The mod adds the ability to refuel old generators with propane — a rare resource that you need to search for. Propane makes the generator fundamentally different:

Regular old generator (on gasoline):
🗣️ Loud — attracts zombies
🔧 Unreliable — breaks down quickly

Propane generator (on propane):
🤫 40% quieter — less noise, fewer zombies
💪 60% more reliable — breaks down 1.6 times less often
🏠 Can be hidden in a small shed — noise will only be heard within 7-8 tiles


🎮 Gameplay

Propane must be found — tanks can be found in grills, garages, and gas stations
Rare resource — 3-4 tanks will last a long time
The choice is yours — spend scarce propane on a quiet generator or use regular gasoline


⚡ Tactical Advantage

The propane generator allows you to do what was almost impossible before:

✅ Quiet city base — you can live right in the center without attracting hordes
✅ Mini-shed — if you surround the generator with walls, the noise radius drops to 7-8 tiles
✅ Less maintenance — the generator breaks down less often, saving electronics for repairs


🕹️ How It Works

1. Find an old generator (they exist on the map, but many ignore them)
2. Get a propane tank (look in grills, garages, hardware stores)
3. Approach the turned-off generator → RMB → "Refuel with Propane"
4. The generator receives improved characteristics


🔧 Compatibility

✅ Build 42.13.1+
✅ Single player
🔄 Multiplayer — technically should work, but not fully tested. Report bugs!

💡 Why This Mod

Old generators are rare but useless. Now they can become your secret weapon for a quiet life in the city.

Before: found an old generator → threw it away/ignored it.
Now: found an old generator + found propane → built a quiet base in the city center.
